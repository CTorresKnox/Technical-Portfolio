## COUNTY ANALYSIS RESEARCH PROJECT

The following research is from a comprehensive economic report for my Applied Economic Analysis Class. Data was sourced through api calls and queries mainly from Census.gov and other state level public databases. Due to the nature of Git, certain figures are positioned differently ccompared to the final deliverable.

## <p align="center"> INTRODUCTION
Nestled in the South-Central Appalachian Mountains are five cities: Kingsport, Bristol, Piney Flats, Blountville, and Bluff City within a 420-square-mile county titled Sullivan. Named after General John Sullivan, a Revolutionary War leader who was captured by the British at the Battle of Long Island, Sullivan County, Tennessee is part of the Kingsport–Bristol TN-VA Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also 2/3rds of the larger Kingsport–Johnson City–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area known as the "Tri-Cities area". Sullivan County is the "birthplace of country music "and has strong cultural ties to rural 'southern' (South Central) Appalachian culture.

## <p align="center"> POPULATION & GROWTH
Tennessee's ninth-largest county, Sullivan, had an approximate population of 160,820 residents in 2022. Sullivan County and the surrounding areas are predominately white. Within the county borders, over ninety-one percent of the population is classified as white. The next largest racial percentage was ‘two or more races’, excluding White, but for identification purposes, the Hispanic or Latino is considered the second largest demographic. The most common ancestries were English, Irish, German, and American. Interestingly, the smaller population of males hold the larger portion of married status while females, the majority populous, have a large lead in the divorce standings. This does not consider domestic violence issues and was derived from marital status and population data. 

 &nbsp; 
The majority female county is predominately comprised of "older" residents, specifically between the ages of 60 to 64 which had the largest five-year percentage. “Minors”, seventeen and younger, fill up a smaller portion of the total population indicating an “elderly” skewed population. The median age in Sullivan County is just under 45 years old while the estimated number of families is nearing 70,000 with an average size of 2.79 family members. Of the population 15 and older 50% of them are married. The average age is 45.3 years old. The County ranked 9th in size and 80th in population of minors (17 and younger). In 2019 Sullivan County was ranked second for the number of children who qualified for Medicaid but were uninsured. 

 &nbsp; 
When compared to counties around it, Washington was the only county with a population near Sullivan’s. Washington County had a population of 136,172 residents in 2022, and contains Johnson City, the third city of tri-cities statistical area. Johnson City has a predominantly younger population, possibly due to Eastern Tennessee University. There is a smaller majority of people identifying as white and a larger population of Hispanics. Sullivan and Washington County are essentially sister counties, for no other counties, including those in bordering states, have similar characteristics. The difference between the two, is that Washington County is growing. 

 &nbsp; 
Sullivan County experienced an .85 percent growth in population over the last ten years. This is barely considered growth, and some might even call it stagnant. With 156,823 residents in 2010 and 158,163 in 2020, Sullivan County’s growth rate not only falls short of the regional growth average, but also undershoots the states county average of 4% growth. This could be due to a multitude of economic factors such as development or low birth rates. Since 2020 it has experienced exponential growth but not a state outlier. Table b illustrates the counties miniscule growth. 


## <p align="center"> REGIONAL TIES
As previously mentioned, Sullivan County is most similar in population to Washington County and resides under Sumner County and over Wilson County in Tennessee population Standings. Sullivan County, Tennessee is part of the Kingsport–Bristol TN-VA Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a piece of the Kingsport–Johnson City–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area. This region is referred to as the "tri-cities area". Bristol TN is also partially in Virginia; however, it is a small part and classified as Bristol, Virginia. Sullivan County had around 18,952 residents who worked in other counties mainly Hawkins, Davidson, and Hamilton County. There is a larger inflow of workers than outflow in Sullivan County. In 2020 32,467 people worked in Sullivan but lived elsewhere. Workers mostly came from Hawkins, Greene, and Unicoi County. Washington County was incorporated into the same statistical area due to low commute times between the tri-cities. 

## <p align="center"> HOUSING
There were 69,704 households in 2022 and the average household was 2.28. 45002 families lived in Sullivan County in 2022. 74.3% of the structures are 1-unit structures. 73.3% of households own it while the other 26.7% rent. We have a 11.6% trailer park household rate. 32.2% of structures were built between 1960 to 1979 while 24.5% were built between 1980 to 1999. The majority of structures have 2 to 3 bedrooms. 8.5% housing vacancy. The median house price in 2022 was $209,200. The median monthly owner cost was $1,116 and 52.9% of housing units did not have a mortgage. The median monthly gross rent was $833 while 65.1% of renters paid between $500 - $999.

The median income for families was $65,841 while married-couple families had a median income of $81,426. Sullivan County has 15.6% of the population below the poverty line. The higher earners were in the medical and science/chemical fields. The mean Social Security income was $23,071, which a lot of residents qualified for due to the older population skew.

 &nbsp;
 The Graph to the left shows the income distribution for Sullivan County in 2022. Surprisingly a good bit of the population makes between 100 to 150 thousand dollars. This also is best explained by an older population, especially where medical and science professionals reside.
 
## <p align="center"> EMPLOYMENT
In 2022 56.4% of the population 16 and over were in the labor force. Less than two and a half percent were unemployed. 87.3% of workers commuted to work with an average travel time of 21.8 minutes.  Which is not horrible. 34.2% of civilians classified their occupations as "Management, business, science, and arts occupations" while the next 21.3% were classified as "Sales and office occupations". 79.3% are private wage salaried workers while government workers comprise less than twelve percent of the employed population. 8.3% were self-employed in non-incorporated businesses. Employment and the local economy have recently seen growth after many years of little to no growth. The number of people employed in Sullivan County but living elsewhere is larger than its counterpart. Sullivan County has relatively higher wages with an average weekly wage greater than $1,100 which is displayed in the chart.

## <p align="center"> INDUSTRIES & EMPLOYERS
Many employers have recently moved to Sullivan County after 2020, but Eastman Chemical Company is the largest employer in Sullivan County with 6,719 employees and it has been there since the 1920s. Holston Valley Medical Center follows with 1,400 employees. Next comes the educational workers from Kingsport City Schools with 1,100 employees. The rest are health systems workers or local government. This explains the majority female population since nurses and, education workers are predominately female. 

&nbsp;
Some of the top industries in the area happen to be manufacturing, healthcare, and education workers. A good portion of the manufacturing field comes from chemical manufacturing with companies like Domtar, Eastman, and BAE Systems. There seems to be a large emphasis on chemists and science roles.

## <p align="center"> STRENGTH & WEAKNESSES
Sullivan County's unique location in Northeast Tennessee allows for access to the Southern Appalachian Mountains to the east. The county is stagnant, and people are moving from cities to rural neighboring counties. Less than one percent use public transportation. There appear to be 7,249 children under the age of 5 and around 40% of them fall below the poverty line. That is statistic is a potential outlier for the state. Counties: Shelby, Knox, and Davidson are nowhere near Sullivans 5-year-old poverty rate.

## <p align="center"> EDUCATION
90.9% of Sullivan County adults ages 25 and over are high school graduates or higher and 24.7% have at least a bachelor's degree. There are 29,809 people 3 years and older enrolled in school. 45.7% in elementary school, 23.4% in high school, 21.3% in college, and just 7% in kindergarten. There are 7 private schools and 17 public schools in Sullivan County. There are 8,380 kids in the Sullivan County school district. The district report card stated that the county's 2023 proficiency rate was 35%. The largest group was nearing expectations at 45% but overall had a 94.4% graduation rate. Compared to cities similar in size Sumner (47%), Wilson (49%), and major state districts, Knox (41%) and Hamilton (39%), Sullivan County's performance is relatively low.

## <p align="center"> RECREATION & TOURISM
Fans of NASCAR rejoice, Sullivan County is home to The Last Great Colosseum. Bristol Motor Speedway holds multiple races and events every year. It also held The Battle at Bristol which holds the record for the NCAA football's largest single-game attendance at 156,990. I attended this event and hearing the National Anthem and God Bless the U.S.A. sung by almost 157,000 people is chilling, to say the least. Sullivan County also offers unique tourism activities for country music lovers and a plethora of historical settlements and forts. Due to the county's unique geographical location in South Central Appalachia, it contains many outdoor settings such as waterways, parks, golf courses, and trails. There are also numerous youth and adult programs/sporting activities.

## <p align="center"> LOCAL GOVERNMENT
In 2022 Sullivan County had $229 million in total debt, $215 million in total expenditures, and $217 million in total revenues. The Local government collected $66,506,556 in 'Local Taxes'. Kingsport and Bristol have the highest City Tax Rates at 1.998 and 1.986 percent with the county rate being 2.406%. The local infrastructure was rated a C-, and while it has all the required amenities and services, The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation invested $9,637,392 into water infrastructure improvements in Sullivan County. (Hoak, 2023). The Local government is also one of the largest employers specifically referring to public services. The following chart is from the Sullivan County Comptroller from 2022.

## <p align="center"> CRIME STATISTICS 
Sullivan County reported 12,461 crimes in 2022, which does not sound terrible compared to Knox County's 30,055 crimes. This is because Knox County has a population three times the size of Sullivans, but when compared to Sumner County, the slightly larger county, it looks worse. Sumner, who has 40,000 more people had around 4,000 less reported crimes. In 2022 the Sullivans County Sheriff's Office reported 226 violent crime incidents, 789 property crimes, and 192 larceny crimes. T. The Sheriff's Office reported 3,064 crimes in 2022. Sullivan County was graded at a C- in safety which indicates that it is just above the national standards for safety/ crime

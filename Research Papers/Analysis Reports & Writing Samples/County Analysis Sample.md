### From the Section " Population and Growth" 

  "The majority female county is predominately comprised of "older" residents, specifically between the ages of 60 to 64 which had the largest five-year percentage. “Minors”, seventeen and younger, composed a smaller portion of the total population indicating an “elderly” skewed population. The median age in Sullivan County is just under 45 years old while the estimated number of families is nearing 70,000 with an average size of 2.79 family members. 
The table bellow illustrates the age breakdown in Sullivan County. Of the population 15 and older 50% of them are married. The average age is 45.3 years old. The County ranked 9th in size and 80th in population of minors (17 and younger). In 2019 Sullivan County was ranked second for the number of children who qualified for Medicaid but were uninsured."

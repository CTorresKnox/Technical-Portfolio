## ABSTRACT
    The United States immigration courts recently approved a historically large amount of
asylum seekers cases in 2022, but the years leading up saw some of the largest denial rates ever.
The fate of asylum seekers has been historically shaped by the attributes of the immigration
judge assigned to adjudicate their case, yet the denial rates between judges have serious
variation. I used individual judge denial rates and descriptive characteristics to formulate a panel
dataset to explore whether specific traits in judges increase asylum denial rates. I found certain
characteristics such as the political affiliation of their state and the sex of the judge to be the
main drivers increasing denial rates, but our model could not find any statistical significance to
explain the variation amongst judge’s rates. My results show that judges in republican voting
states have denial rates 30 percentage points higher than their counterparts and male judges have
denial rates that are 8 points higher than female judges.

## INTRODUCTION
    There are over 650 immigration judges presiding across 68 immigration courts.
Appointed by the Attorney General of The United States, these judges rule on cases regarding
asylum seekers. There is no surprise that denial rates vary from judge to judge across the country,
but the variation between judges in the same immigration court also varies dramatically. For
example, Judge Paul McCloskey had a denial rate of 91.3% while the Honorable Lawrence
Burman had a denial rate of only 15.3% and they are both currently assigned to the Arlington
Immigration Court. This continued to puzzle me since asylum cases are randomly assigned to a
judge’s docket which is supposed to help normalize distribution of cases. This issue of variation
amongst judges is not new because Karen Musalo, director of the Center for Gender & Refugee
Studies at the University of California Hastings School of the Law in San Franciso said in an
interview with Reuters that “It is clearly troubling when you have these kinds of gross
disparities,” (Rosenberg, 2017). Whether or not I believe her statements to be true, I still believe
the topic is worth investigating.

## LITERATURE REVIEW 
    Many organizations have studied the variation of asylum decisions, but none have more
insightful information than Transactional Records Access Clearing house (TRAC) at Syracuse
University. TRAC constantly produces studies and analyses on a variety of topics, but a study
from 2018 titled Asylum Outcome Continues to Depend on the Judge Assigned had practical
significance. The report analyzes the variance of rates by different classification such as the
specific courts and similarities, but notes “that while judge-to-judge decision disparities have
long existed, between 2010 and 2016 judge-to-judge decision disparities got worse.”
(TRAC,2018). To me, this signifies that it is an ongoing scenario that deserves to be studied.
Tracs results were as follows, “Under these circumstances any large differences in the denial
rates of individual judges are unlikely to be the result of differences in the nature of the incoming
cases. Instead, they are likely to reflect the personal perspective that each judge brings to the
bench.” (TRAC,2018).
  
    The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) also does a very thorough
report into variation amongst immigration courts and judges. A report from 2008 titled
Significant Variation Existed in Asylum Outcomes across Immigration Courts and Judges deeply
into factors that could explain the extreme variation. They used probability parameters to try and
predict the likelihood of judge’s decisions. GAO was able to access more personal data on the
judges and were able to include variables like race and age. Their study produced the following
results: “the immigration judge characteristics that had significant effects on asylum decisions, at
least when we considered each characteristic one at a time, were gender, length of service as an
immigration judge, veterans preference, prior public immigration experience, and prior
experience doing immigration work for a non-profit organization.” (GAO,2019). These variables
were a basis for my research and guided me towards my results.
